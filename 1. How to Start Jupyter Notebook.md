## **Goals + Background Info**

This tutorial is for macOS + Windows and its main goal is to provide step by step instructions on installing Jupyter Notebook on your computer so we can start coding! 

This tutorial assumes that you _do not_ have anaconda downloaded or access to Jupyter Notebook on your local machine. If you already have these installed, there is no need to complete this tutorial and you can proceed to other notebooks. Also in the following steps, I will be using terms like __terminal__ and __command prompt__ so I will define those below!

_What is Jupyter Notebook?_

The [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is the original web application for creating and sharing computational documents. We will be using Jupyter Notebooks for all of our following Climate DataLab tutorials! It offers a simple, streamlined, document-centric experience. Jupyter supports over 40 programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, and Scala. In our tutorials we will be using mostly __Python__, although selected R tutorials are also available.

For macOS: _What is the Terminal?_

Terminal is an app which comes automatically installed on Mac computers, that lets you communicate with the Mac operating system using a command line interface (CLI). You enter commands and scripts (called shell scripts) to perform tasks on your Mac.

For Windows: _What is the Window's Command Prompt Window?_

Command Prompt" or "CMD," is a text-based interface already installed on a Windows computers where users can type commands to interact with the operating system and perform various tasks. This is the equivalent to the macOS Terminal, and performs all the same functions.

## **Option 1: Download Anaconda**

This first option is the quickest and easiest method. Following the steps below will help you download Anaconda Navigator from the web and launch Jupyter Notebook.

_What is Anaconda ?_

[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is an open-source distribution of the Python programming language, specifically designed for data science and machine learning. Anaconda provides a collection of pre-installed packages and a package manager called __"conda"__ to simplify the installation and management of various data science libraries we will use in these tutorials.

Anaconda includes Python, JupyterLab, and many other popular libraries.

### Steps:
- Go to [Anaconda’s official website](https://www.anaconda.com/) and download the latest version for your operating system.

- Follow the installation prompts for your OS (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

- Once installed, open **Anaconda Navigator** or **Anaconda Prompt**.

To start Jupyter Notebook from Anaconda Prompt (Windows) or Terminal (Mac/Linux), type:

`jupyter notebook`

## **Option 2: Download Miniconda**

If you prefer a smaller installation, Miniconda is a lightweight version of Anaconda.

_What is Miniconda?_

Miniconda is a free, miniature installation of Anaconda Distribution that includes only conda, Python, the packages they both depend on, and a small number of other useful packages.


### Installation for Windows:
- Download Miniconda from [Miniconda’s official page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

- Run the installer and follow the installation steps.

- Open the **Command Prompt** and verify the installation:

`conda --version`

### Installation for macOS/Linux:
- Download Miniconda from [Miniconda’s official page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

- Run the following command in Terminal:

  
`bash ~/miniconda.sh -b`
 

- Remove the installer (optional, to save space):

`rm ~/miniconda.sh`


### Install JupyterLab from terminal or Command Prompt

 - Now use the newly installed miniconda to install JupyterLab from your terminal + command prompt

`conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab`

- Last Step! JupyterLab can then be opened by typing

`jupyter lab`

Well done! Now you can move on to coding !
