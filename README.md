# Climate Data Lab: Getting Started
Thank you for checking out the Climate DataLab GitHub! 

This repository contains tutorials that will guide you through setting up the tools you'll need to work with climate model output:
- Git/GitHub
- Python
- Jupyter/Jupyter Lab

To work with these notebooks, [clone this repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) and open the notebook you'd like to work with on your local machine. (Note: you will probably want to follow the Markdown-format instructions for tutorial 1 first, if you don't already have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed!)

If you have code of your own you would love to add to this repository please email us at sstevenson@ucsb.edu or fhozven@gmail.com.

Hope this helps and please also be sure to visit the main [Climate DataLab website](https://climate-datalab.org/) for more information and video walkthroughs.
